This is the functional and structural MRI data used for the following studies:

Hamm, A.G. and Mattfeld, A. T. (in press) Disting Neural Circuits Underlie Prospective
and Concurrent Memory-Guided Behavior, Cell Reports


Folders are organised in subject number (e.g. sub-001). Within each folder there are subfolders with the following:

1) anat - T1-weighted structural scan

2) func - contains BOLD data for:
- Our novel conditional visual associative learning task, with kaleidoscopic images used as stimuli,
with 6 scans across three sets of images. 

Please note that not all participants finished all tasks, or scans. See papers for a description.
